      "summary": "I'm a senior applications engineer holding a master's in integrated circuits and systems and a bachelor's in electronics and communication engineering. I've primarily worked on Wi-Fi radios from the Infineon/Cypress portfolio. I have experience in these radios' hardware, software, and regulatory aspects. I'm eager to explore fresh opportunities and responsibilities in design, applications, or firmware development. I also want to use the opportunity to improve my skills, knowledge, and network and help take the team to new heights.",
